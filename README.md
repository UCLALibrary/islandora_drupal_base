# UCLA DLP's Base Drupal Installation

This is the base installation for the Digital Library Program's Drupal multi-site architecture.  It contains the core modules that we use.  Individual multi-site sites may choose to use custom modules.  These would be found in the site's GitHub repository.

## Multisite Site Registration

We keep track of which sites have been registered for use (regardless of whether the site is in production yet or not).  To see this list (or edit it), visit its [wiki page](https://github.com/UCLALibrary/islandora_drupal_base/wiki/Islandora-Multisite-Registration).
