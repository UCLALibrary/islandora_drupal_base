# Islandora Drupal Base

Base Drupal instance for all DLP projects. This should be the starting point for setting up a new Drupal project. After cloning this and installing its default database, a [multisite template](https://github.com/UCLALibrary/islandora_drupal_subsite_template) can be cloned and used as the base for a new site within this Drupal instance.  There are instructions for this process on the subsite template repository's wiki.
